# Drag Tac Toe 
## Privacy Policy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** September 8, 2024

I, Ihab Shoully, developed the game "Drag Tac Toe" as a paid, offline app. This game is provided for a one-time purchase fee and is intended for use as is.

### Information Collection and Use
We do not collect, store, or process any personal data. The game operates entirely offline with no internet access or permissions. Your privacy is our priority, and we ensure that no personal information is captured, transmitted, or used in any way.

### Local Storage
The game uses local storage on your device for the following purposes:

* **Player Names:** Stored in shared preferences. We do not have access to this data.
* **User Preferences:** Saves a setting to avoid re-prompting for player names if already entered.
* **Scores:** Stored temporarily in RAM and deleted when the app is closed. A scoreboard keeps records of the last ten games, saved in shared preferences. This data continuously overrides to keep only the most recent ten records. Users can delete all records at any time.

### No Third-Party Services
We do not use any third-party services or libraries that might collect or process data.
