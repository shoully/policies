# Drag Tac Toe 
## Privacy Policy

Version: 1.0
Date: August 26, 2024

I, Ihab Shoully, developed the game "Drag Tac Toe" as a paid, offline app. This game is provided for a one-time purchase fee and is intended for use as is.

### Information Collection and Use
We do not collect, store, or process any personal data. The game operates entirely offline with no internet access or permissions. Your privacy is our priority, and we ensure that no personal information is captured, transmitted, or used in any way.

### Local Storage
The game uses local storage on your device for the following purposes:

* Player Names: Stored in shared preferences. We do not have access to this data.
* User Preferences: Saves a setting to avoid re-prompting for player names if already entered.
* Scores: Stored temporarily in RAM and deleted when the app is closed. A scoreboard keeps records of the last ten games, saved in shared preferences. This data continuously overrides to keep only the most recent ten records. Users can delete all records at any time.

### No Third-Party Services
We do not use any third-party services or libraries that might collect or process data.

### Children's Privacy
This game is suitable for all ages. We do not collect any personal information from children, and parents can confidently allow their children to play without concerns about privacy.

#### User Rights under LGPD
In compliance with the LGPD, if personal data were to be collected, users in Brazil would have the following rights:

* Portability: The right to request data portability.
* Opposition: The right to oppose the processing of their personal data.

### General Guidance for Parents
I encourage parents to review the game before allowing their child to use it and to set limits on screen time to protect their eyesight.

### Changes
This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. We will review and update this policy with each new version of the app.
